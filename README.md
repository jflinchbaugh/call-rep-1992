# CALL-REP (1992)

This is the GWBASIC source code for one of my first major pieces of software.
It's the call reporting system for Yorkana Volunteer Fire Company that we used
for tallying reports on emergency calls to submit to the boroughs and townships
we served.

Some data is included.

REPORT.BAT launches the software. It should run in DosBox. Additionally, it should
also run in PCBasic.
